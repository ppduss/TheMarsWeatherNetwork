## The Mars Weather Network


This project was created using two [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/): APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and InSight: Mars Weather Service API. <br />

*"NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth plain near Mars’ equator. This API provides per-Sol summary data for each of the last seven available Sols (Martian Days). As more data from a particular Sol are downlinked from the spacecraft (sometimes several days later), these values are recalculated, and consequently may change as more data are received on Earth."*<br />

Also featuring an image gallery and clickbait article carousel like those often seen on sites like [The Weather Network](https://www.theweathernetwork.com/).
